The most simple physics library.

This is a project of a simple physics library where all objects are rectangles without rotation. There's no need to complicate your software if you don't need thousand of fantastic and useless resources.

The main objective of this engine is to support simple 2D platformer games. The PetalDanceDemo gives a basic idea of how to use the library.
